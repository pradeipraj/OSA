TECHNICAL DESIGN PAGE USER MICROSERVICE...

OVERVIEW:
The User Microservice is responsible for managing user-related functionalities, 
including authentication, authorization, user profiles, and preferences.

ARCHITECTURE:
Programming Language: Java (Which Version?)
Framework: Spring Boot (Java)
Database: MySQL/AWS
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication.

HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE:
RESTful API endpoints for communication. 
It interacts with other microservices such as the Stock Microservice, 
Order Microservice, and Authentication Microservice.

FUNCTIONALITY:
	1. User Registration and Authentication:
		Endpoint: osa/api/users/register (POST): Allows users to create an account.
		Endpoint: osa/api/users/login (POST): Authenticates users and generates a JWT token for subsequent requests.

	2. User Profile:
		Endpoint: osa/api/users/{userId} (GET): Retrieves user profile information.
		Endpoint: osa/api/users/{userId} (PUT): Allows users to update their profile information.

AUTHORIZATION:
	Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
	Define roles such as User or Admin.

SECURITY:
	Implement HTTPS for secure communication.
	Store passwords securely using industry-standard hashing algorithms like bcrypt.
	Use JWT tokens for authentication and authorization.

ERROR HANDLING:
	Define clear error messages and status codes for API responses.
	Log errors for debugging purposes.
	
TESTING: 
	Implement unit testing with code coverage.
	integration tests (if Required).
	end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the microservice.

DOCUMENTATION:
	Create comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.

DEPLOYMENT:
	Utilize continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

FUTURE CONSIDERATION:
	Consider features like user notifications, password recovery.
